          As the urban centers become overcrowded, hygiene and sanitation fall as disease and epidemics spread rapidly. Urban centers therefore grow in size to meet the required population capacity and continually push back the rural urban fringe, which is the boundary between urban and rural areas. To develop urban areas, large amounts of land must be cleared and excavated to construct infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings etc. Very often, the clearance of land requires deforestation and this leads to fewer trees holding the soil together. The soil becomes loose and easily erodes due to the erosive agents of wind and rainfall. Hengeveld writes of how mountain forests were cleared such that the trees could no longer protect the forest floor against erosion and rain water ran off with ever-greater force, first removing the humus and then the mineral soil and stone (Wasted World, 160). Soil degradation is a major consequence of deforestation and loss of soil fertility adversely affects the agricultural potential of the land and therefore food production. Hengeveld discusses the effects of overpopulation and its influence on deforestation when he writes how “population growth results in vast deforestation as our demand for agricultural land and wood for timber for all aspects of urbanization are still increasing, and our tools for cutting down trees are becoming ever-more efficient and powerful” (Wasted World, 162).
