      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        ... has led to an inflow of workers and opportunists in cities, which furthers disease, shelter shortages, and food shortages. Urbanizing and expanding into new lands must be done to increase the carrying capacity of that specific area. However, to develop and urbanize new lands, involves clearing and burning forests to construct infrastructure such as roads, buildings, and houses. Clearing land causes fewer trees to hold the soil together, leaving it in worse conditions and makes the soil loose which easily erodes from erosive agents like wind and rainfall; these erosive agents first remove the humus and mineral soil and stone. Soil degradation is a major consequence of deforestation and decreasing soil with crop production potential negatively impacts agriculture. There is lots of backlash that happens due to overpopulation and how it influences the destruction of forests. For example, the rapid growth of the population means that there is a large growth in deforestation. As the world needs more land for agriculture, urbanization, cities, neighborhoods and much more, the more forests we will need to cut down and the less trees we will end up having. The connection here is that as populations grow, forests shrink.
